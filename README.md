# Computational-Model-for-BRAT

Here, we compare 4 different models for the Balloon Risk Aversion Task (BRAT), a variation of the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART).
All the models were fitted through both hierarchal Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Files related to MLE are located in the MLE folder. All the fitted samples in either rds or RData format can be found in a link in the presentation explaining reproducibility. Model 2 showed to be best model out of the four.
